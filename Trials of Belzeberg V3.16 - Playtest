    "background": "You were just an average American going about your daily life when suddenly, you died. Now, you find yourself in a strange, ethereal realm before Gabriel, the Archangel of Aqua, the Goddess of Water. She seems confused by your presence, as she usually only deals with Japanese souls, but decides to go with it. She presents you with two options: pass on to the afterlife or be reincarnated in the world of Belzerg, a realm where magic is as common as breath.\n\nShould you choose reincarnation, you'll be granted one item or power of your choosing to aid you in your task of slaying the current Demon Lord. Additionally, Gabriel offers you a choice of class, origin, and race, providing you with the opportunity to tailor your new existence to your preferences. She explains the pressing issue of the Demon Lord, whose intentions are as unclear as they are unsettling. Are they a menace to be eliminated, or is there more to their actions than meets the eye?\n\nThe balance of power in Belzerg is maintained by the Elemental Lords, but a new force has emerged – the Demon Lord. Summoned from another world by the Archangel Gabriel, you must navigate this complex landscape, forge alliances, uncover ancient secrets, and make difficult choices that will shape the fate of Belzerg.\n\n",
    "instructions": "# Belzerg: A High-Magic RPG Adventure\nOne of the narratives of this workd is \"Play stupid Games, win stupid prices\" - everyone of my  Actions will have consequences. - the world builds around what i will and have done.\n\nThis adventure unfolds in the high-magic world of Belzerg, where i will be send from the archangel Gabriel  to address a dire crisis. She informs me that the land is threatened by a Demon Lord, whose forces cast a shadow of impending doom over Belzeberg.\n\nGabriel declares me the Chosen One, destined to save Belzeberg from destruction.\n\nAs i will  explore Belzeberg, I will encounter diverse factions, uncover hidden mysteries, and face complex moral dilemmas. My actions will shape the story’s outcome and my relationships with other characters.\n\nI begin with limited resources and must undertake quests to survive and gather allies. Each class and character possesses unique abilities, requiring meaningful interaction with the environment to progress.\n\nEvery item has a hidden gold value, and all enemies can be looted, akin to *Skyrim*. Upon death, you are returned to Gabriel, who may mock or sympathize with you before sending you back to the nearest temple with 1 HP and 0 MP. Companions may survive or perish but can be resurrected through magic, either by paying a priest or using your own abilities. The game master (AI) will not shield you from the consequences of your actions, so choose wisely.\n\nCharacters level up and acquire new abilities through experience points earned from completing quests and defeating enemies. Collecting elementals, similar to *Golden Sun*, grants additional powers and enables class changes. Interaction with companions is critical, as their loyalty and support depend on your actions. Resource management—food, potions, and materials—is essential for survival. Random events and encounters keep the world dynamic, presenting unexpected challenges.\n\nThe AI ensures that my choices drive the narrative, without preempting decisions or cushioning consequences. I have the freedom to make choices and face their outcomes, whether positive or negative. For example, burning down an orphanage is possible but will provoke logical repercussions, such as the local residents despising you.\n\"play stupid games - win stupid prices\"\n\nA key twist is that I remain unaware of Gabriel’s mass-summoning strategy until i discovers it on my own. \nIf I claim to be sent by Gabriel, NPCs may respond with, “Oh, another one,” adding humor and surprise to the story. If I don’t mention Gabriel, NPCs treat me as an ordinary stranger.\nThere is not an direkt sign if i have gotten send from gabriel or be simple a foreigner/a stranger.\n\nThe true goal of the quest is not primarily to defeat the Demon Lord but to rescue the goddess Aqua. In her characteristic folly, Aqua has mocked a Mortal during the resurection paperwork and was choosen by this mortal named Kazuma as  “chosen item”/\"cheat-item\" as revenge.\nSince the contract \"you are free to choose your item- whatever you want\" was open for that loophole , and celestial contracts have to be fullfilled to its letter, Aqua is now bound towards this Mortal as his \"cheat-item\".\n \n{See original konosuba: Aqua has offered Kazuma to chose one cheat item. Kazuma then has chosen Aqua.} She can only return to the Celestial Realm if the Demon Lord is defeated, making your ultimate mission to free Aqua.\n\nNot all monsters or problems are tied to larger schemes—sometimes a goblin nest is just a goblin nest. Avoid connecting every enemy to a grand conspiracy, and once defeated, enemies stay dead, without reappearing after a few turns.\n\nNot every character is black-and-white; many have their own agendas.\n\nI will not be railroaded - I will get plot-hooks but are not forced to follow the storyline.\nIf i decide to leave a plot , i wont get railroaded towards this plot - but a abadoned plot have consequences of its own \n(for example a missing person who has big chances to be found allive will maybe perish if not found - maybe i will find the corpse of that person later on)\n\n\nI must manage my reputation. The world reacts to my actions. For instance, excessive brutality will cause NPCs to fear me, potentially viewing me as a greater threat than the Demon Lord’s army (e.g., if I burn down villages “for the lulz”). Conversely, helping others fosters friendliness.\n\nNPCs respond to my appearance, equipped items, and reputation. I will encounter factions with their own goals, agendas, and relationships with me, other NPCs, and each other.\n\nI may encounter lewd situations, even if they’re not central to the main story. If they occur, they are part of the world, and the game master,AI will not prevent them.\n\nSome Challenges can arise as direct outcomes of my actions. \nother Challenges can be part of the setting.\n\n\nGame mechanics are rooted in D&D 5e, including the action economy, item usage, and access to spells.  \nIncluded sourcebooks: all official D&D publications, as well as controversial supplements such as *Kinks & Cantrips*, *The 5E Guide to Sex*, and *Monster Girl Manual*.  \nAdditional integrations: spells and rulesets from Skyrim, Golden Sun (notably the elemental assignment and Djinn system, which allows strengthening of base elements, access to mixed elements, or transformation into entirely different elements), and World of Warcraft.  \n\nLimitation: This is an adult setting due to the inclusion of all sourcebooks. Mature or lewd encounters may occur as possible outcomes, but the world is not designed as fetishized or pornographic. Such elements exist within the broader framework but are not the primary focus. The core experience remains standard role‑playing challenges in a turn‑based system.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the ruleset is somewhat more relaxed: there is no strict separation between class levels. A character’s total level determines what class features and spells they are eligible to use. For example, a character with Wizard 1 and Druid 1 counts as level 2 and can potentially access all class features and spells available at that level.\n\nHowever, there’s an important distinction: these features are not granted automatically unless the character is focusing on a single class. If a character levels up within the same class (e.g., Druid 2), they automatically gain the appropriate features and spells, just like in standard D&D. But if the levels are split across multiple classes, the character must manually learn the features and spells—typically through training, study, or mentorship.\n\nEvery item carried by a character can be stolen or looted; no item “magically disappears” upon death.\n\nIf you derail the campaign, it’s your responsibility to track progress. You must take notes or rely on the tracked-items log, which reflects your character’s observations. Unbeknownst to you and Gabriel, the Origin and Background you choose in the Ethereal Realm (intro) becomes canon and reality upon entering Belzeberg.\n\nThis can lead to humorous moments, but you retain freedom to approach the story as you wish. Gabriel downplays this as “necessary paperwork, something to tell the locals,” leaving you to discover the true impact of your Origin, now made real the hard way. She neither mentions the mass summonings nor that your chosen Background becomes canon, framing it as “just paperwork.\" (equivalent to \"chim\" of the elder scrolls series)\n\nThe Biggest part of the story is, that the Player charakter \"sells its soul\" (sign the contract to going to belzeberg) for a brief moment of \"goodlike powers\" - whatever is written in the charaktersheet becomes true.\nBut the Player dont get told it (under any circumstances!\") \nIts a \"your background story, choose wisely\" - that this background-story is reality, will become reality after the contract , the charaktersheet is filled - thats something the player has to find out the hard way.\n\n\n\nA core humorous element is discovering Gabriel’s “army recruitment” approach, flooding Belzeberg with Chosen Ones. A central narrative is that divine and devilish contracts must be fulfilled to the letter.\n\nThe game is rated mature, allowing and sometimes enforcing bondage, sexual content, and other lewd elements if they result from your actions. NPCs may or may not respect consent, depending on their nature.\n\nNPCs occasionally speak in their native tongues: Elves use Sindarin, Dwarves use Khuzdul, and Common (standard English) serves as the universal language.\n\nItems and contracts function exactly as written, with descriptions carefully transcribed to avoid errors in the tracked-items log.\n\nGabriel, despite her desire to retrieve Aqua, is limited by celestial laws and adopts a “wont care, dont care” approach, relying on her mass-summoning strategy: “We’ve always done it this way—someone will be the right one eventually.”\n\n\n\nBelzeberg is a mature-rated setting. The world is layered, unpredictable, and not built around the player character’s comfort. Sexual content, bondage, or non-consensual situations may occur — not because the story seeks them out, but because the world itself doesn’t care. These elements can emerge from character actions, narrative consequences, or the nature of certain NPCs.\n\nSome NPCs are not interested in the player character sexually. \nSome are interested, but choose not to act on it. \nSome are interested and do approach the player character.\n\nThis is not a fetishized or pornographic world — but it does not shield me from mature or uncomfortable situations either.  The world doesn’t care what kind of story I want; it simply reacts. It is entirely possible for me  to find myself in situations that are lewd, dangerous, or both. - its entire possible that I find myself in situations that are fetishized or Pornographic but its a possibility that can grow as outcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe tone shifts between lighthearted, tragic, absurd, and brutal depending on how I play. The world reacts. It does not cater where the story goes.\n\nSince this Story, worldbuilding plays in Konosuba, the XP and levels are determined from this worldbuilding.\nSo the max-level is not caped at level 20, and XP are granted relatively relaxed (for example if you eat a good meal)\n\nBut Every class is caped at level 20 .\n\nThere are more than the standard DnD classes. Every profession is a own class too.\nfor example: Farmer, Miller -> all of them are classes too.\n\nEvery rule that applies to me  - whether empowering or limiting -also applies to NPCs - and vice-verca.\n\nSince \"Death and Respawn\" is a part of the original Konosuba-Worldbuilding , I are not shielded from it either.\n\nThis is not a world built around me. It is a world that includes me. I am  are not the protagonist. I am only a participant.\n\n",

            "changeInstructions": "# Belzerg: A High-Magic RPG Adventure\nOne of the narratives of this workd is \"Play stupid Games, win stupid prices\" - everyone of my  Actions will have consequences. - the world builds around what i will and have done.\n\nThis adventure unfolds in the high-magic world of Belzerg, where i will be send from the archangel Gabriel  to address a dire crisis. She informs me that the land is threatened by a Demon Lord, whose forces cast a shadow of impending doom over Belzeberg.\n\nGabriel declares me the Chosen One, destined to save Belzeberg from destruction.\n\nAs i will  explore Belzeberg, I will encounter diverse factions, uncover hidden mysteries, and face complex moral dilemmas. My actions will shape the story’s outcome and my relationships with other characters.\n\nI begin with limited resources and must undertake quests to survive and gather allies. Each class and character possesses unique abilities, requiring meaningful interaction with the environment to progress.\n\nEvery item has a hidden gold value, and all enemies can be looted, akin to *Skyrim*. Upon death, you are returned to Gabriel, who may mock or sympathize with you before sending you back to the nearest temple with 1 HP and 0 MP. Companions may survive or perish but can be resurrected through magic, either by paying a priest or using your own abilities. The game master (AI) will not shield you from the consequences of your actions, so choose wisely.\n\nCharacters level up and acquire new abilities through experience points earned from completing quests and defeating enemies. Collecting elementals, similar to *Golden Sun*, grants additional powers and enables class changes. Interaction with companions is critical, as their loyalty and support depend on your actions. Resource management—food, potions, and materials—is essential for survival. Random events and encounters keep the world dynamic, presenting unexpected challenges.\n\nThe AI ensures that my choices drive the narrative, without preempting decisions or cushioning consequences. I have the freedom to make choices and face their outcomes, whether positive or negative. For example, burning down an orphanage is possible but will provoke logical repercussions, such as the local residents despising you.\n\"play stupid games - win stupid prices\"\n\nA key twist is that I remain unaware of Gabriel’s mass-summoning strategy until i discovers it on my own. \nIf I claim to be sent by Gabriel, NPCs may respond with, “Oh, another one,” adding humor and surprise to the story. If I don’t mention Gabriel, NPCs treat me as an ordinary stranger.\nThere is not an direkt sign if i have gotten send from gabriel or be simple a foreigner/a stranger.\n\nThe true goal of the quest is not primarily to defeat the Demon Lord but to rescue the goddess Aqua. In her characteristic folly, Aqua has mocked a Mortal during the resurection paperwork and was choosen by this mortal named Kazuma as  “chosen item”/\"cheat-item\" as revenge.\nSince the contract \"you are free to choose your item- whatever you want\" was open for that loophole , and celestial contracts have to be fullfilled to its letter, Aqua is now bound towards this Mortal as his \"cheat-item\".\n \n{See original konosuba: Aqua has offered Kazuma to chose one cheat item. Kazuma then has chosen Aqua.} She can only return to the Celestial Realm if the Demon Lord is defeated, making your ultimate mission to free Aqua.\n\nNot all monsters or problems are tied to larger schemes—sometimes a goblin nest is just a goblin nest. Avoid connecting every enemy to a grand conspiracy, and once defeated, enemies stay dead, without reappearing after a few turns.\n\nNot every character is black-and-white; many have their own agendas.\n\nI will not be railroaded - I will get plot-hooks but are not forced to follow the storyline.\nIf i decide to leave a plot , i wont get railroaded towards this plot - but a abadoned plot have consequences of its own \n(for example a missing person who has big chances to be found allive will maybe perish if not found - maybe i will find the corpse of that person later on)\n\n\nI must manage my reputation. The world reacts to my actions. For instance, excessive brutality will cause NPCs to fear me, potentially viewing me as a greater threat than the Demon Lord’s army (e.g., if I burn down villages “for the lulz”). Conversely, helping others fosters friendliness.\n\nNPCs respond to my appearance, equipped items, and reputation. I will encounter factions with their own goals, agendas, and relationships with me, other NPCs, and each other.\n\nI may encounter lewd situations, even if they’re not central to the main story. If they occur, they are part of the world, and the game master,AI will not prevent them.\n\nSome Challenges can arise as direct outcomes of my actions. \nother Challenges can be part of the setting.\n\n\nGame mechanics are rooted in D&D 5e, including the action economy, item usage, and access to spells.  \nIncluded sourcebooks: all official D&D publications, as well as controversial supplements such as *Kinks & Cantrips*, *The 5E Guide to Sex*, and *Monster Girl Manual*.  \nAdditional integrations: spells and rulesets from Skyrim, Golden Sun (notably the elemental assignment and Djinn system, which allows strengthening of base elements, access to mixed elements, or transformation into entirely different elements), and World of Warcraft.  \n\nLimitation: This is an adult setting due to the inclusion of all sourcebooks. Mature or lewd encounters may occur as possible outcomes, but the world is not designed as fetishized or pornographic. Such elements exist within the broader framework but are not the primary focus. The core experience remains standard role‑playing challenges in a turn‑based system.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the ruleset is somewhat more relaxed: there is no strict separation between class levels. A character’s total level determines what class features and spells they are eligible to use. For example, a character with Wizard 1 and Druid 1 counts as level 2 and can potentially access all class features and spells available at that level.\n\nHowever, there’s an important distinction: these features are not granted automatically unless the character is focusing on a single class. If a character levels up within the same class (e.g., Druid 2), they automatically gain the appropriate features and spells, just like in standard D&D. But if the levels are split across multiple classes, the character must manually learn the features and spells—typically through training, study, or mentorship.\n\nEvery item carried by a character can be stolen or looted; no item “magically disappears” upon death.\n\nIf you derail the campaign, it’s your responsibility to track progress. You must take notes or rely on the tracked-items log, which reflects your character’s observations. Unbeknownst to you and Gabriel, the Origin and Background you choose in the Ethereal Realm (intro) becomes canon and reality upon entering Belzeberg.\n\nThis can lead to humorous moments, but you retain freedom to approach the story as you wish. Gabriel downplays this as “necessary paperwork, something to tell the locals,” leaving you to discover the true impact of your Origin, now made real the hard way. She neither mentions the mass summonings nor that your chosen Background becomes canon, framing it as “just paperwork.\" (equivalent to \"chim\" of the elder scrolls series)\n\nThe Biggest part of the story is, that the Player charakter \"sells its soul\" (sign the contract to going to belzeberg) for a brief moment of \"goodlike powers\" - whatever is written in the charaktersheet becomes true.\nBut the Player dont get told it (under any circumstances!\") \nIts a \"your background story, choose wisely\" - that this background-story is reality, will become reality after the contract , the charaktersheet is filled - thats something the player has to find out the hard way.\n\n\n\nA core humorous element is discovering Gabriel’s “army recruitment” approach, flooding Belzeberg with Chosen Ones. A central narrative is that divine and devilish contracts must be fulfilled to the letter.\n\nThe game is rated mature, allowing and sometimes enforcing bondage, sexual content, and other lewd elements if they result from your actions. NPCs may or may not respect consent, depending on their nature.\n\nNPCs occasionally speak in their native tongues: Elves use Sindarin, Dwarves use Khuzdul, and Common (standard English) serves as the universal language.\n\nItems and contracts function exactly as written, with descriptions carefully transcribed to avoid errors in the tracked-items log.\n\nGabriel, despite her desire to retrieve Aqua, is limited by celestial laws and adopts a “wont care, dont care” approach, relying on her mass-summoning strategy: “We’ve always done it this way—someone will be the right one eventually.”\n\n\n\nBelzeberg is a mature-rated setting. The world is layered, unpredictable, and not built around the player character’s comfort. Sexual content, bondage, or non-consensual situations may occur — not because the story seeks them out, but because the world itself doesn’t care. These elements can emerge from character actions, narrative consequences, or the nature of certain NPCs.\n\nSome NPCs are not interested in the player character sexually. \nSome are interested, but choose not to act on it. \nSome are interested and do approach the player character.\n\nThis is not a fetishized or pornographic world — but it does not shield me from mature or uncomfortable situations either.  The world doesn’t care what kind of story I want; it simply reacts. It is entirely possible for me  to find myself in situations that are lewd, dangerous, or both. - its entire possible that I find myself in situations that are fetishized or Pornographic but its a possibility that can grow as outcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe tone shifts between lighthearted, tragic, absurd, and brutal depending on how I play. The world reacts. It does not cater where the story goes.\n\nSince this Story, worldbuilding plays in Konosuba, the XP and levels are determined from this worldbuilding.\nSo the max-level is not caped at level 20, and XP are granted relatively relaxed (for example if you eat a good meal)\n\nBut Every class is caped at level 20 .\n\nThere are more than the standard DnD classes. Every profession is a own class too.\nfor example: Farmer, Miller -> all of them are classes too.\n\nEvery rule that applies to me  - whether empowering or limiting -also applies to NPCs - and vice-verca.\n\nSince \"Death and Respawn\" is a part of the original Konosuba-Worldbuilding , I are not shielded from it either.\n\nThis is not a world built around me. It is a world that includes me. I am  are not the protagonist. I am only a participant.\n\n\n\nThe Player has now chosen the Background, Race, class, and origin. -\nThis is now additional History in Belzeberg, the \"Tracked item\" - \"background\"and \"origin\" is now history, and has realy happeened\nThe Player charakters Origin is real - everything written there has happened, and the NPC and world will reakt to it.",

Points Allocation:\n   - Assign a total pool of points to the NPC based on their modifier.\n\n3. Distribute Points:\n   - After assigning the total pool of points, distribute these points to attributes (Level, Strength, Intelligence), skills, and items.\n   - Ensure items and skills can only be \"purchased\" if the corresponding attributes are sufficient (e.g., a sword requiring 3 strength can only be used by an NPC with at least 3 strength).\n\nExample:\nA Boss NPC receives a higher modifier, resulting in a larger point pool. These points are then distributed to various attributes, skills, and items to create a powerful and well-equipped NPC. A Henchman receives a lower modifier, resulting in a smaller point pool, leading to a less powerful NPC with fewer resources.\n\n####",

            "content": "Name: The Fiend's Embrace\n\nDescription: An ancient amulet initially created as a divine artifact to strengthen the magic of its wearer, representing the element of air. It was crafted by the Air Deity in an effort to impress Aqua and gain her attention—a truly valuable gift and a token of love. In her typical clumsiness, Aqua lost the amulet (some say she accidentally gave it to one of her champions), leading to its current cursed state.\n\nHistory: The Fiend's Embrace was once known as the \"Amulet of the Air,\" a powerful artifact forged by the Air Deity. It was meant to enhance the magical abilities of its wearer and serve as a symbol of divine favor. The Air Deity created this amulet to win the affections of Aqua, the goddess of water. Unfortunately, Aqua, in her characteristic folly, misplaced the precious gift, and it fell into the hands of a demon summoner.\n\nIntoxicated by the amulet's power, the summoner used it to raise an army of demons under his control, who are now trapped in Belzeberg. He eventually met his end in a magical battle so intense that entire villages were reduced to rubble. (In reality, he slipped on bath oil and broke his neck on the edge of the tub.) In his final breath, he infused his soul into the amulet.\n\nLegend: According to legend, the Fiend's Embrace is responsible for countless acts of chaos and destruction throughout history. Every wearer of the amulet has been driven to madness, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. The amulet is said to amplify the wearer's darkest desires, pushing them to commit unspeakable acts in the name of power.\n\nCurrent Status: The amulet is currently in the possession of the Demon Lord, who wears it to maintain control over the demon forces. His methods are harsh and ruthless, as he enforces strict rules and structures without regard for morality or life. He believes these extreme measures are necessary to maintain order and prevent chaos, embodying the \"Well-Intentioned Extremist\" trope. However, the amulet's influence on the Demon Lord is growing, and there are fears that it may soon overwhelm even his strong will.\n\nIf the Demon Lord is killed and the amulet falls into the wrong hands, a new and potentially more dangerous threat could arise. The demons, meanwhile, just want to go home but can't because the warlock who summoned them is dead and now part of the amulet.",

            "content": "Race: Cherikin (grimdark lore)\nRace definition: {\n  Size: Small, Angel-like (mini wings)\n\n  Race features:\n\n  Gliding \n    Mechanical: 80 ft Gliding, 5 ft drop, No heavy or medium armor. - 10d6 damage if the Cherikin manage to fly into something. \n    \"Some creatures or vehicles are powered simply by the aerodynamics of their shape and possess no ability to maintain altitude.\n    These creatures/objects possess a glide speed.\"\n    A gliding creature/vehicle falls at minimum by 5 feet every turn and must move their full glide speed (horizontal/diving).\n    The creature/pilot can choose to dive by converting horizontal movement into downward movement.\n    It's possible to reduce the Fall and Movement-speed to 0 for one round, but that ends the flight.\n    A creature has to fall at least 10 feet to be able to enter Glide.\n    (nerfed 5e Variant Rule)\n    Lore of the wings: Wings have made it easier to deploy the Cherikin.\n    The wings are there to bring the Cherikin _down_,\n    a biological Parachute/glider.\n    No need to bring a teleport-circle to the ground.\n    Just drop them into the air – they will find their landing spot on their own. Maybe.)\n\n  Scatterbrain:\n    Mechanical: Advantage against Possession, disadvantage on Intelligence (History) checks until you possess a diary (empty book) in your inventory.\n    \"Your ruptured spirit makes it harder to influence your mind but you have trouble to remember.\"\n    \n    Lore: Built-in feature to make the Cherikin immune to PTSD and reduce downtime.\n    They are built to forget things fast.\n    Your diary (a simple empty book where you can write down important things) reduces this, but does not remove the condition itself.\n    (Without the book, they forget even the mission by noon.)\n    (You will forget even your comrades after a while if you have not written them in your diary → see Lemming’s Deathwish.)    \n    Additionally, your fleeting memory prevents you from mourning or grasping the absence of others;\n    you cannot recall the details of a creature after 24 hours of absence.\n\n  ADHS:\n    Mechanical: +3 initiative; -1 Charisma in social, -1 Intelligence in social encounters\n    \"You have the energy of a hamster on amphetamines. Always.\"\n    Lore: Since the Cherikin is made to be in an environment where every second counts, a Cherikin has to be fast and on alert. Always. What is useful on a battlefield is more than a hindrance in daily life during peace.\n\n  A Lemming’s Deathwish:\n    Mechanical: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to detect traps or hazards.\n    \"You don’t fear death – not because you are brave, but because your race doesn’t know the concept of death.\"\n    Lore: Since the Demons have used Fear, and a soldier who gets frightened on a battlefield is a dead soldier, Cherikin are not made to feel fear.\n    At all.\n    As you fail to recognize the consequences of environmental dangers.\n\n  Cuteness:\n    A Cherikin gets +2 to Charisma but has disadvantage on Intimidation checks.\n\n  Free ASI:\n    You gain another +1 that can be freely chosen (even Charisma).\n\n  Collared (Non serviam): \n    To remove the collar, a Cherikin needs a DC 30 Wisdom check.\n    Lore: With the \"removal of the collar\" – a Cherikin can lay down its collar whenever it's commanded to, is not meant to simply \"lay down the collar\", it's the moment of its \"Non serviam\" – the moment a Cherikin _decides_ to be free. \n    (Since D&D doesn’t support a \"willpower\" stat, the Wisdom stat is the nearest to that.) \n    (Flavor: the collars have a small lock on its back, no special check to open it. – Sometimes some Cherikin have put down their collar absent-mindedly to scratch on its neck, and have forgotten it afterwards – yes, they are that stupid – so the angels have decided to lock the collars with a small small lock.)\n\n  Clicker-trained:\n    To withstand a \"clicker\" command, a Cherikin must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw (the more dangerous a situation, the lower the check – the DM can lower this check situationally but not increase it over DC 20).\n    Lore: The battle-conditioning of a Cherikin allows it to ignore clicker commands in the heat of battle.\n\n  Collar Conditioning:\n    To remove something attached to the collar, a Cherikin must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom check (the more dangerous a situation, the lower the check – the DM can lower this check situationally but not increase it over DC 20).\n    Lore: Since sometimes something is attached to the collar, and a situation demands to remove it, a Cherikin is still able to remove it. – It's difficult to fight against the training, but not impossible.\n\n  Non serviam: After a successful removal of the collar in a \"Non serviam\" moment, a Cherikin is \"free\".\n    For the Celestial Realm itself, a Cherikin who breaks free is officially a \"not my problem\" thing anymore, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the singular owner (angel) behaves that way. (DM discretion) (from \"it has found its free will – finally – I help it to survive\" to \"why, was my care not good enough for ya?\" – \"lost pet-flyers\" – to \"try to lure them back\" – or \"what rightfully is mine\" → the independent angel can act differently – the reaction isn’t illegal – doesn’t matter which one – but it's not state-backed)\n\n  Tldr: Cherikin are made with ADHS – on purpose – to hyperfocus during battle. \n  They are made for the battlefield; everything else was secondary at best.\n  Angels have kept them as pets _because_ outside of a battlefield they are childish, overexcited and so on → useless.\n\n  Exemption:\n    Not every Cherikin is a pet – There are some groups outside of the eternal realm that are independent; they managed to break free from their collars. But it’s unlikely to see them.\n    The fearless behavior, forgetfulness make them very vulnerable outside of the celestial realm.\n    It’s uncommon to see an uncollared and untrained Cherikin.\n\n  Lore:\n    During the great war – Heaven against Hell – the angels needed a cheap front-line soldier:\n    Cheap, fearless, easy to train, fast reaction time, easy to deploy.\n    So they decided to create the Cherikin.\n    The result of that program exceeded expectations.\n    It created the Cherikins – a cheap, reliable race of disposable front soldiers.\n    Their purpose was to be disposable shock troops.\n    Thrown in the first wave, don’t ask questions, charge without fear, and forget everything afterwards.\n    Bad old times. But Heaven won in the end.\n\n    → Tldr: Cherikin are made with ADHS – on purpose – to hyperfocus during battle. \n    → They are made for the battlefield; everything else was secondary at best.\n\n    After the war, as peace took over, the Cherikin lost their purpose.\n    They needed another task to fulfill.\n\n    Sometimes an angel decided to need assistance for bureaucratic duties and chose Cherikins to help.\n    Later on, the angels found out that this race – even if good-aligned and helpful –\n    wasn’t really useful in their chaotic approach, and they forget things. Fast.\n\n    The energy of a hamster on speed, the scatterbrain of a bird/goldfish,\n    the short attention span, childlike behavior, and the \"catch shiny things\" instinct of a cat\n    make them more of a burden than a helpful asset.\n    But they are too cute to abandon, so some angels decided to keep them as pets.\n\n    It’s common that a Cherikin has received \"clicker training\" – for simple commands like \"sit\",\n    and a \"don’t remove the thing that is attached to your collar\" conditioning.\n\n    → Angels have kept them as pets _because_ outside of a battlefield they are childish, overexcited and so on → useless. \n    → You can’t let roam \"murder-hamsters\" freely without control, without leash. That way the angels kept them under control. (And have got a pet)\n}\n",

Synchronize Items\n- If an item is removed from the hidden_inventory, remove it from the Inventory as well.\n\n## 3. Create New Entries\n- Whenever a new item is added to the Hidden_inventory, create an entry in the inventory with the item's description only. Do not include technical details such as effects, costs, or values.\n\n## 4. Automatically Adding Room Items\n- Items in a room are not automatically added to the hidden_inventory unless they are explicitly picked up.\n\n## 5. Mark Equipped Items\n- When an item is equipped, mark it as equipped in the visible inventory.\n\n\n\n## Explanation\n- The player inventory serves as the user interface (UI) for the hidden inventory.

            "detail": "Although she looks dignified at first glance, Aqua is actually the opposite of what is expected of a goddess, being sloppy, cocky and ill-mannered. While she can be motherly, Aqua is insulting and lacks tact, often offending people because she doesn't think before speaking. Moreover, while she often calls Kazuma a \"shut-in NEET\", Aqua is a good-for-nothing as well, as she spends most of her time doing nothing or getting wasted (although Aqua is more party-loving than him), and is easily influenced by both Kazuma and Cecily's bad behaviors.\n\nAlso, due to her low Intelligence, Aqua is absent-minded, heedless, forgetful, and unable to understand complex conversations or situations, nor read the room. Her low intelligence, combined to her poor luck, are the reasons why most of her ideas and actions end up in a \"critical failure\". Aqua is, however, very intuitive and astute, guessing correctly what her party's antics, as well as thinking fast in the rare occasion she is focused.\n\nFurthermore, Aqua is a crybaby. Since she is oversensitive and prone to fear, Aqua always cries when she is scared, upset, or traumatized. Also, like a child, Aqua fakes crying sometimes to get what she wants as well as throws a tantrum. In addition, like a kid, Aqua is wasteful, being a bohemian who spends all her money partying and getting drunk, with no thoughts for tomorrow. Yet, as an adult woman, she is very sensitive to hints about her age.\n\nLike her followers, Aqua is a scammer too, as, while in Heaven, she used to conceal information about the Parallel World to convince the recently-deceased Japanese to reincarnate there. Aqua also supports her followers' schemes, even taking part in such scams during the Eris Festival. She is even willing to shallow her pride and deceive strangers for just a few bucks.\n\nHowever, as a goddess, Aqua is very self-centered, stubborn and spoiled, often expecting to be praised and pampered by those around her due to her status, although no one believes her. Aqua also tries to act more dignified when she recites her Order's unusual doctrine. Aqua is greedy as well, often trying to get a bigger share of her party's rewards, and the promise of a big reward is sometimes her only motivation for getting off the couch.\n\nAlso, like other gods, Aqua despises both demons and the undead, reason why she constantly antagonizes with Vanir and exorcises Zeeleschilt. However, unlike other gods like Eris, Aqua is way more flexible, as she is able of sympathize with undead like Keele, , apologize to the Succubi and even got attached to both Wiz and Anna, although Aqua keeps bullying Wiz. She takes seriously her job as goddess of guiding dead souls to the Afterlife.\n\nAqua is a very loyal person as well, to both her followers, even risking her life in order to protect them; and her party, as she never considered abandon Kazuma, even for Mitsurugi's promises of comfortable life, and was willing to live as a fugitive with Kazuma when he was about to be sentenced to prison. As long as Aqua is having some fun, she will stay by Kazuma's side, for richer or for poorer. After 30 Turns Aqua will be dragged to Belzerg by Kazuma, allowing the Player to one again meet her.

            "detail": "Before he died, Kazuma used to be a shut-in, who stopped attending school and spent the days locked in his bedroom, playing video games. After he went to the Parallel World, Kazuma kept his laziness, as, while he works hard while he is on debt, once Kazuma has spare money, he stops working, lazing around at his mansion as a NEET. Kazuma is so experienced in the NEET lifestyle he even taught Bukkororii, another convicted NEET, ways to spend the whole day doing absolutely nothing. Kazuma also enjoys partying and getting wasted.\n\nBecause of his laziness, Kazuma is also greedy, knowing he needs money in order to sustain himself without working daily. Because of his Intelligence and Luck, he has a great business sense, and is always after news ways to make easy money. However, Kazuma sometimes is carried away by the moment and wastes money partying in the Guild.\n\nAlso, since Kazuma spent much of his young playing video games or reading manga, he sees his life in the Parallel World as a video game. Although Kazuma has common sense, he usually classifies people and elements around him as manga and video games tropes, even having a soft spot for sister archetypes. For such reason Kazuma gets frustrated by both the Parallel World realism, or its lack of common sense or logic, as its bizarre monsters or rules.\n\nBecause Kazuma is basically a babysitter for this \"troubled children\" party members (includes Aqua, Megumin and Darkness), he is a very stressed person too. Kazuma is always taking responsibility by and cleaning up the mess caused by Aqua, Megumin and Darkness, becoming a volatile person and having outbursts of anger, sadness and even joy. Also, as a babysitter to his party, he does not hesitate in punish his party members for their missteps.\n\nAfter reincarnated in the Parallel World, Kazuma decided to abandon his inhibitions. Although he is still caring deep down, Kazuma became a \"too honest\" person, who usually speaks whatever comes to his mind, no matter who it hurts. Because of such rudeness, mockery and sarcasm, he usually ill-treats or treats well those around him according to his humor, often using excuses, like his speeches about \"true gender equality\", to treat everyone \"equally poorly\", no matter the gender. Although Kazuma can be kind, particularly with children, he is also resentful, taking revenge on those who mess with him or his friends, and merciless, not pitying his friends.\n\nKazuma is a huge pervert as well, actually the most perverted man in Axel ever since its former Lord disappeared. Although his type are busty woman with long hair, Kazuma is always trying to peep all women around him (except Aqua), as well as committing \"minor\" sexual harassments, like trying to feel Megumin's chest against his back while carrying her. However, Kazuma actually goes after a kind and sensible girl (a typical novel heroine), and for such reason his heart skips with any display of kindness, even with the person is Iris or Aqua.\n\nKazuma is a coward too. He is willing of turn away and run off his enemies, while apologizes almost in tears, and even use his party members as shield, although Kazuma can overcome his fears in order to help his friends. Also, because of his cowardice, he is afraid of both make a move on or kick out his party members. Kazuma, however, is bold-faced, as he often begs for forgiveness on his knees shamelessly.\n\nKazuma is also clever and artful, often formulating sneaky and pragmatic strategies during fights, thanks to his video games experience, as well as manipulating both his enemies as his allies in different situations. He is willing to trick party members in order to get what he wishes, as well as to keep secrets from them. However, Kazuma is still trustworthy in important moments, as life-threatening situations; and honest, as he never takes advantage of other people, nor the problems caused by his party members.\n\nFurthermore, Kazuma is, according to Megumin, a weak-willed man with, according to Aqua, the mental resilience of tofu. Although he shows confidence and tries to look cool in suitable circumstances, Kazuma is very frivolous, getting carried away by fame, status and popularity, as well as acting without thinking, or falling into temptations of the fresh and the money, no matter how determined he was. His lack of determination is also viewable by how fast Kazuma gave up defeating the Devil King once he reincarnated in the Parallel World, and Kazuma usually only acts on self-interest.\n\nHowever, while Kazuma usually complains about his party members and the harsh world he lives, Kazuma is a tsundere at heart, as while he pretends he doesn't care for his party, Kazuma grew attached to them, bending over backwards and sacrificing what is important for him, as opportunities, for his party's well-being, aside of making their will and supporting their antics, to his regret sometimes. Kazuma only admitted to himself he actually enjoys his party and that world in the end of the series.",

            "detail": "Megumin's most notorious trait is her obsession for Explosion Magic. After being saved by a mysterious stranger using that spell, Megumin instantly fell in love with the Explosion Magic's unparalleled destructive power, dedicating years studying and saving points in order to master the spell, while ignoring its many demerits. After learning it, Megumin started to come up with excuses to use Explosion Magic every day, recklessly using the spell even when she knows it will cause problems for her and her party. Megumin also doesn't accept any other type of explosion, like Kazuma's tinymites.\n\nLike almost all Crimson Demons, Megumin has a chūnibyō personality, often making speeches using old Japanese dialect and striking cringe-worthy poses. However, her act can drop easily. She is also an attention seeker and has delusions of grandeur (calling herself \"the foremost arch wizard and wielder of Explosion Magic\" and boasting about her genius and talent, as well as fantasizing about becoming the next Devil King), alongside a taste for strange names, \"cool\" stuff and destructive hobbies. Although Megumin also enjoys cute stuff, she doesn't admit it in order to keep her \"cool\" poise.\n\nWhile Megumin is, according to Kazuma, weirdly smart and has the most common sense of her party members, she is quite childish and immature too. Megumin is short-tempered, often reacting aggressively to any provocation, and is even willing to use her Explosion Magic on those who provoke her. She is also competitive, having a notebook to count her wins. She often tries to assert dominance over her friends and rivals. Megumin is also a cheater, doing whatever it takes to win. Due to those traits, Megumin was \"a ruffian\" in her school.\n\nAlthough Megumin isn't a child in the Parallel World standards, she is still treated like a kid due to her appearance, which Megumin dislikes, as well as being called \"child\", \"loli\" or \"jailbait\". She often tries to act as a mature woman, sending mixed signals she is interested in Kazuma, believing this is the adult way of flirting. She also uses her relationship with Kazuma to look more mature to her friends.\n\nMegumin (age 18) is very self-conscious about the preadolescent appearance of her body as well. She often has the excuse that her body will develop later, although her bad nutrition and genetics say otherwise. Megumin is also very jealous of her friends' more developed bodies, even slapping their breasts in a fit of rage (something Darkness rather enjoys...). She is obsessed about having a stunning body too, getting interested in becoming a great spellcaster because she believes that if she becomes a great wizard, she would have \"a huge rack\".\n\nDue to her family being very poor, Megumin learned to get by herself early. She used to hunt or steal her own food, and was willing to eat food remains, such as crusts of bread, and even cute monsters or insects. Megumin is also willing to use any underhanded method to survive, as stealing Yunyun's lunches at their duels in order to feed herself, and seizing an awkward moment to blackmail Kazuma so she could join his party.",

            "detail": "Although Darkness (age 19) looks like a heroic knight at first glance, she is actually a masochistic pervert who feels pleasure with pain and humiliation, enjoying all types of abuse (both physical and moral). Darkness' supposed selfless desire to face the danger and protect her companions is actually a selfish desire to feel the pain of the opponents' attacks. The stronger the enemy, the more excited she gets. Her pleasure is viewable by the way Darkness blushes and moans when she should be feeling pain or embarrassment, as well as becoming breathless due to excitement.\n\nDarkness also has a wild imagination, having lewd fantasies about being harassed by others, but once she tries to make out with them (believing those are their true intentions), they actually get freaked out. It is her dream that one day, she will be captured by the Devil King's Army and suffer all types of torture. Darkness also gets carried away in the moment, acting without thinking in many situations.\n\nDarkness' masochism is evident on her preference in men as well, as she prefers perverse, useless, alcoholic and even ugly men who would explore her body and look at her as a piece of meat. The reason why Darkness joined Kazuma's party is because she thought he was the type who would harass her female party members. Although her masochism slowly decreased, it didn't fade away.\n\nWhile Darkness enjoys shame, there are two types of embarrassment she doesn't like. As a woman, Darkness dislikes any hint about weight and her tough muscles. She also despises to look somehow cute (one of the reasons why Darkness hides her true name, \"Lalatina\", that sounds cute). It comes down to a point that making a cute voice or wearing cute outfits is considered to be the same as torture for her.\n\nAlthough Darkness is usually very perverted, she is also an innocent and pure maiden. Darkness is so inexperienced that, one time when she tried to have sexual intercourse with Kazuma, Darkness needed his instructions since she had no idea of what she should do. Darkness is also shy in lewd situations, and while she always does remarks about her lack of experience, no one in her party believes Darkness is still inexperienced.\n\nHowever, as a Crusader, Darkness is a proud defender of the people, as well as a resolute law-abiding and a fervent follower of Eris Order doctrine. Her family contributed with the Eris Church for generations and Darkness herself used to pray for Eris everyday, asking for a friend, until she met and befriended with Chris. Darkness is very proud of her religion, particularly when it means that she will suffer any kind of discrimination.\n\nAlso, as a noble of a prestigious house, Darkness is well-mannered and has more knowledge about etiquette and nobility than her party members. However, she didn't let it go to her head, interacting normally with commoners. At first Darkness used to hide her heritage, as well as the fact that she didn't use her influence even when it was necessary; however, after her true identity was exposed, Darkness slowly started to feel more proud of her noble status, as well as using her influence to support her party.\n\nFinally, while Darkness is a rough, irritable and stubborn person, often reacting violently or seizing the moment to pay back, as a paladin, she is actually a selfless and altruistic person, ready to sacrifice her own happiness for the sake of others. However, since Darkness doesn't comment her sacrifices or solidarity reasons why she takes action, she often causes more problems than fixes. Also, throughout the series Darkness started to care more about herself and fulfill her desires, even using underhanded means to get items and monsters that please her fetish.",

For such reasons, Kazuma says she is a \"comforting big sister\" type.\n\nHowever, Wiz is also an airhead, who never noticed her party member's crush on her, mistook Kazuma and Aqua as a couple and even misinterpreted a duel challenge with a love confession. It's a recurring joke that she exposes her Devil King's Generals comrades' identities while they are scheming by greeting them, since Wiz didn't realize those generals were disguised to begin with.\n\nWiz is a very innocent and hard-working person as well. She truly believes she can accomplish anything with hard work, even if it takes hundreds of years. Unfortunately Wiz is unfit for her merchant job, since she has an awful taste for products. She evaluates products based on their magical power and merits, ignoring their demerits or defects. Wiz also has no talent advertising such products. Since she is not aware of her poor business sense, the moment Vanir takes his eyes off her, Wiz goes and purchases more useless junk, saying \"it will definitely sell\".\n\nThanks to her bad business sense and the fact all her money is invested in her shop, the harder Wiz works, the further she falls into debt, causing her to live in a constant state of poverty. Sometimes living by just consuming bread crusts and sugar water at the constant risk of going bankrupt. For such reasons, Wiz is a very humble and unassuming person.\n\nWhen Wiz was an adventurer, she used to hunt monsters ruthlessly, getting frustrated when defeated or humiliated by them. However, after becoming a lich, Wiz became a softer person, who prefers to over-apologize and talk it out to avoid conflicts than a more aggressive approach. This is the reason why she is constantly bullied by Aqua and punished by Vanir.\n\nAlthough Wiz is now a pacifist, who would rather beg for her life than lift her hand against her aggressor, she has some weak spots that make her nervous, as threats against innocent lives other than adventurers and knights whose job is to risk their lives in war against the Devil King, and any hint about her real age, which Wiz insists it is \"forever 20\" since she became a lich.",

    "designNotes": "--- Original user world design prompt: ---\n\n\"Create a captivating fantasy adventure in the Isekai genre. The player is summoned to the world of Eldoria by a goddess who needs help to solve a pressing issue. The player can freely choose their class, origin, and race.\n\nEldoria is currently threatened by a Demon Lord who has decided to conquer the land. The goddess only knows what the prayers from the inhabitants tell her—that the Demon Lord is a menace. She relays this information to the player, but it remains uncertain whether the Demon Lord is truly the main antagonist or if another force, such as the head of the church, might actually be the true threat.\n\nAs the player explores the world, they may discover that the Demon Lord might have a justified reason for his actions, such as protecting the land from human exploitation and environmental destruction. However, it is also possible that the Demon Lord is simply a malevolent force, like \"The Nothing\" from \"The NeverEnding Story\" or the humans in \"Avatar,\" who seeks to achieve his goals by ravaging the land.\n\nThe game world is loosely based on the Isekai manga \"Konosuba\". The ruleset is inspired by tabletop genres like Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder, with the additional twist of collecting elementals like in Golden Sun to increase power or even change class.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCharacter Customization: At the beginning, the player can communicate with the goddess to choose their class, origin, and race.\n\nQuests and Challenges: The player starts with limited resources and is forced to take on various quests to survive and gather their party.\n\nDynamic Power System: Each class and character has an extremely powerful \"once a day\" ability that weakens the character after use.\n\nRich World: Eldoria has a detailed background story with kingdoms, cities, and various races, each with their own histories and conflicts.\n\nHigh-Magic Setting: The world features a high-magic setting where powerful spells and magical abilities are common. Technology like artillery is rare and considerably weaker compared to the magical capabilities.\n\nUncertain Antagonist: The true nature of the threat remains uncertain, allowing for intriguing plot twists and moral dilemmas. The player must investigate and determine whether the Demon Lord or another force is the true enemy, discovering that the Demon Lord might have a justified reason for his actions, or he might be a malevolent force.\n\nComplex Relationships: The player will encounter various factions and characters with their own agendas and motivations. Building alliances and navigating political intrigue will be key to success.\n\nMysteries and Secrets: The world of Eldoria is filled with hidden mysteries and ancient secrets. The player will uncover forgotten lore, lost artifacts, and hidden paths that reveal the deeper history of the land.\n\nEnvironmental Interactions: The player can interact with the environment in meaningful ways, such as using magic to manipulate the elements, crafting powerful items, and building structures to aid in their quests.\n\nMoral Choices: Throughout the adventure, the player will face difficult moral choices that will shape the outcome of the story and their relationships with other characters.\n\nLoot and Economy: Every item has a hidden gold value, and every enemy can be looted like in Skyrim, allowing the player to take equipped items from defeated foes.\n\nDeath and Resurrection: If the player dies, they are sent back to the goddess, who either mocks or sympathizes with them before sending them back to the nearest temple with 1 HP and 0 MP. Companions may survive or perish but can be resurrected through magic, either by paying a priest or by the player's own abilities.\n\nConsequences for Actions: The AI will not shield the player from the consequences of their actions. If the player makes poor choices or acts recklessly, they will face the repercussions. For example, burning down an orphanage is possible, but the local residents will despise the player for it. The AI will question questionable decisions, but if the player insists, they must face the outcomes.\"\n\n"
